## 🛠 Opening the Settings

You’ll see the window with these settings:


#### 🧩 General Settings

| Setting                       | Description                                                                                    |

| **Logging type**             | Controls how much info you want to see in the Unity console.                                   |
| **Emotions**                 | Add at least one emotion. These are passed to the LLM.                                         |
| **Not in Assets folder**     | Check this if you moved the framework folder outside the default location.                     |
| **Directory name** *(if above is checked)* | For example: if your folder path is `Assets/MyImports/Frameworks`, enter `MyImports/Frameworks`. |
| **Custom Ollama URI** | If empty, Ollama URI will be default "localhost:11434" |
